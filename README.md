#### üß† About the Quiz

- You earn **1 point** only if:
  - You select **all correct answers**
  - And **none of the incorrect ones**
- Skipping or selecting incorrectly = **0 points**
- At the end, you'll see:
  - Your **total score**
  - A **detailed review** showing your answers vs the correct ones

#### üéÆ Available Quiz Modes

- **Standard Mode** ‚Äì shows all answer options at once (like a real exam)
- **Blind Mode** ‚Äì shows one option at a time, helping reduce bias and increase focus
